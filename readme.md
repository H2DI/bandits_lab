# What this is

This is my (HÃ©di Hadiji's) personal research code. I implement algorithms I wish to understand better, and generate some experiments. Everything is pretty rudimentary.

This is not meant to be used a library, but rather as inspiration if someone wants to implement some algorithms and reproduce experiments.

If you are looking for something closer to an extensive python bandit library, I suggest looking at Lillian Besson's


# How to use it

##### Requirements
python 3.5 +
numpy
cvxpy (for some specific cases)
joblib


## Experiments for some papers

Adaptation to the range in K--armed bandits

MeDZO

KL-UCB switch

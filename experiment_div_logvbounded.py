"""
    Definition of the problems considered
        - the probability set considered is a triangle,
        - we build a family of  bandit problems, defined by their mean vectors.
        For the last two mean vectors, the optimal (mixed) action in on the border
        of the simplex, whereas for the fist two, the optimal action is in the
        interior of the simplex. We know that the regret has to grow at least
        logarithmically in the latter case.

        We conjecture that diversity-preserving UCB yields bounded regret when
        the optimal action is on the border.
